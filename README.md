Convert questions from excel to QTI (Question Test Interoperability) format by pasting content in excel.

Write questions and answers in excel and copy the columns into the tool. It will then convert the content to a QTI (Question Test Interoperability) file
which you can upload to Canvas. I am not sure if the QTI-file will be compatible with other platforms.

A live example can be seen here: http://www.erlendthune.com/xborrow/canvastabtoqti.php

A video describing how to use the tool can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUbYqePDrow
